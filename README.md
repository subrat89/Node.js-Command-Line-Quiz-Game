# Node.js Command-Line-Quiz-Game
A basic interactive quiz application built with Node.js that runs directly in your terminal. 
Test your knowledge with multiple-choice questions!


‚ú® Features
Loads questions from a questions.json file.
Presents a specified number of random questions.
Prompts the user for their answer (by entering the number corresponding to the choice).
Validates user input.

üöÄ How to Run
Follow these steps to get the quiz running on your local machine:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.

Installation
Clone the repository (or download the code directly):

Bash
git clone <your-github-repo-link>
cd <your-repo-name> # e.g., cd simple-nodejs-quiz
(Replace <your-github-repo-link> with the actual link to your repository once you create it on GitHub. Replace <your-repo-name> with the name you give your repository.)

Install dependencies:
This project uses prompt-sync to get synchronous user input.

Bash
npm install
(This command will install all dependencies listed in package.json. If you don't have a package.json yet, you might need to run npm init -y first, and then npm install prompt-sync.)

Usage
To start the quiz, simply run the project.js file using Node.js:




Bash
node project.js
The quiz will present a question, and you'll need to enter the number corresponding to your chosen answer.
